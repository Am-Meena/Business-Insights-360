<h3 align="left">Recommendations :</h3> 

- Leverage advanced forecasting models (e.g., M.L algorithms) that incorporate real-time data to reduce errors. Frequent adjustments to forecasts based on market conditions and customer behaviour could help refine forecast accuracy.
- Conduct a detailed cost analysis to identify areas where costs can be reduced, such as operational inefficiencies. Implement cost-control measures, particularly in high-expense areas like logistics, manufacturing, and procurement.
- Focus on product portfolio optimization by promoting high-margin products. Consider eliminating low-margin products or adjusting pricing to ensure every product contributes to profitability.
- Adopt advanced inventory management systems to prevent stockouts (OOS). Using AI-powered tools to forecast demand and optimize stock levels would minimize OOS occurrences while balancing inventory holding costs.
- Reevaluate the discounting strategy to ensure it is aligned with profitability goals. Consider offering targeted discounts based on customer segmentation and purchase behaviours, rather than broad-based discounts that might affect margins.
- Shift the focus from revenue growth to profitability by implementing a cost-to-profit improvement program. Look for efficiency gains in production, delivery, and marketing operations, and align incentives for sales teams with profit targets, not just revenue.
